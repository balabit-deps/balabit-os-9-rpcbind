rpcbind (1.2.5-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since version 1.2.5 upstream has turned off the remote calls functionality
  in order to improve security. This can be turned on at build time.
  This functionality caused rpcbind to open up random listening ports. This
  change broke up broadcasts requests to rpcbind making systems depending
  on this feature unusable, e.g. NIS systems.
  
  This release accepts the new command line parameter 'r' to turn on the
  remote calls functionality when needed.

rpcbind (1.2.5-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  rpcbind now ships a default configuration file under '/etc/default'. If
  /etc/rpcbind.conf exists the default configuration file values will
   be overridden.
